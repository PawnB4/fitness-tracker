# FITNESS TRACKER - STATS & PROGRESS IDEAS

## üèãÔ∏è EXERCISE PROGRESSION TRACKING

### Weight Progression
- **Estimated 1RM progression**: Instead of raw weight, calculate estimated 1RM using formulas (Epley, Brzycki) to compare different set/rep schemes
  - Example: 3x5 @ 40kg = ~45kg 1RM, 4x12 @ 28kg = ~40kg 1RM (shows regression)
- **Volume-adjusted progression**: Track weight increases at same rep ranges
  - Example: Bench press at 8-10 reps: 60kg ‚Üí 62.5kg ‚Üí 65kg over time
- **Personal Records** dashboard showing max weight achieved for each exercise at different rep ranges (1RM, 3RM, 5RM, 10RM)
- **Progressive overload tracking**: Show when user increases weight, reps, or sets from previous session
- **Plateau detection**: Alert when estimated 1RM hasn't improved in 3-4 weeks for same exercise

### Volume Progression
- Total volume per exercise (sets √ó reps √ó weight) over time
- Volume progression charts comparing current vs previous months
- Volume per muscle group distribution
- Weekly/monthly volume trends
- Volume-based personal records

### Rep & Set Performance Tracking
**Examples of what this tracks:**
- **Rep progression**: User does bench press 3x8 @ 60kg, next week does 3x10 @ 60kg (improved endurance)
- **Set completion**: User plans 4 sets but only completes 3 ‚Üí 75% completion rate

## üìä WORKOUT ANALYTICS

### Frequency & Consistency
- Workout frequency heatmap (like GitHub contributions)
- **Workout streaks**: Track consecutive days with workouts OR consecutive weeks with X workouts
  - Example: "7-day streak" = worked out 7 days in a row
  - Example: "4-week streak" = completed 3+ workouts per week for 4 weeks straight
- Days between workouts tracking

## üí™ MUSCLE GROUP BALANCE

### Training Distribution
- Pie chart of training volume per muscle group
- Weekly muscle group coverage tracking
- Muscle group imbalance warnings (e.g., "Chest volume 3x higher than back volume")
- Training frequency per muscle group
- Recommended muscle groups to focus on

### Exercise Type Analysis
- Upper body vs lower body vs core vs cardio distribution
- Exercise variety tracking (how many different exercises per muscle group)
- Compound vs isolation exercise ratio
- Exercise rotation suggestions to prevent staleness

## üéØ GOAL SETTING & ACHIEVEMENTS

### Achievement System
- **Consistency badges examples**:
  - "Week Warrior" (7 consecutive workout days)
  - "Monthly Crusher" (completed 16+ workouts in a month)
  - "Routine Master" (followed workout plan for 30 days straight)
  - "Volume King" (hit 10,000kg total monthly volume)
- Exercise mastery: "Performed squats 50 times", "Bench press specialist (100 sessions)"

### Progress Predictions
- Projected timeline to reach weight goals based on current progression
- Estimated 1RM calculations based on sets/reps/weight
- Monthly progress forecasting
- Goal achievement probability based on current consistency

## üìà COMPARATIVE ANALYTICS

### Historical Comparisons
- "This month vs last month" performance
- "This year vs last year" progress
- "Best month ever" achievements
- Seasonal performance patterns
- Performance after breaks/rest periods

## üî• MOTIVATION & ENGAGEMENT

### Progress Celebrations
- Weekly progress summaries
- Monthly achievement reports
- "You're stronger than X weeks ago" comparisons
- Improvement percentage calculations

## üì± DASHBOARD IDEAS

### Main Dashboard Widgets
- Current streak counter
- **This week's total volume example**: "This week: 8,450kg total lifted (vs 7,200kg last week)"
  - Could be helpful to show overall training load and compare week-to-week
- **Recent personal records examples**:
  - "New 5RM: Bench Press 70kg" (3 days ago)
  - "Volume PR: Squat 2,100kg this week"
  - "First time: Deadlift 2x bodyweight"
