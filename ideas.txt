# FITNESS TRACKER - STATS & PROGRESS IDEAS

## üèãÔ∏è EXERCISE PROGRESSION TRACKING

### Weight Progression
- Line charts showing weight increases per exercise over time // How would you calculate the bar chart? If one day the person does 3x5 with 40kg and next week the does 4x12 with 28kg, did they improve or worsen? What can we show in the line chart that would make sense?
- "Personal Records" dashboard showing max weight achieved for each exercise
- Weight progression rate (kg/lbs gained per week/month) // Same question here
- Plateau detection alerts when weight hasn't increased in X weeks // Same question here, do you mean by weight not improving? Maybe we can do this on a 
- Suggested weight increments based on progression patterns

### Volume Progression
- Total volume per exercise (sets √ó reps √ó weight) over time
- Volume progression charts comparing current vs previous months
- Volume per muscle group distribution
- Weekly/monthly volume trends
- Volume-based personal records

### Rep & Set Improvements
- Rep progression tracking (moving from 8 reps to 12 reps at same weight)
- Set completion rates (% of planned sets actually completed)
- "Endurance gains" - track when users can do more reps at same weight
- Set consistency tracking (completing all planned sets)
